# Create a new function to compute the chi-squared test statistic
# The function's name is chisq, the required input is a data table 
# Obs(erved) is the observed data table; variables are defined later
# Exp(ected) is a contingency table computed from the Observed data
# Outer is the outer product of two vectors, which makes a matrix
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_product
# http://calculator.vhex.net/calculator/linear-algebra/outer-product
```{r}
chisq.teststat<-function(Obs)
{ 
  Exp <- outer(rowSums(Obs),colSums(Obs))/sum(Obs)
  sum((Obs-Exp)^2/Exp)
}

# Load the dataset
Berkeley <- read.csv(file=url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/berkeley.csv"))

# Select the two variables we want to test and make a table
Observed <- table(Berkeley$sex,Berkeley$status)
Observed
addmargins(Observed)

# Use function to calculate the chi-square test statistic (obs.diff)
obs.diff <- chisq.teststat(Observed)
obs.diff 

# This computes the expected counts if we want to see them, but this
# step is not necessary for the hypothesis test; the function does it
Expected <- outer(rowSums(Observed),colSums(Observed))/sum(Observed)
